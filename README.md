# Facebook-Dropdown-Select-Demo
This project demonstrates handling dropdown menus on Facebookâ€™s registration page using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It uses the Select class to interact with day, month, and year fields. The script shows selection by visible text, value, and index, while also verifying if the dropdown is multi-select.
